## About Me

My passion primarily lies in software development, with a strong focus on web development and backend development. I've always been interested in technology, which has motivated me to continue developing myself and specializing in modern technologies and frameworks.

My personality traits are: extraversion, intuition, thinking, and judging. I enjoy working on development projects, both frontend and backend. I'm motivated, eager to learn, and enjoy working in a team, but I also like to take the lead on projects. My focus is on writing efficient, scalable, and well-structured code.
